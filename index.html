                    Hacking refers to unauthorized access to or manipulation of computer systems or networks.
                    This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities or using malicious software to gain control of a system.
                    Hacking can be done for a variety of reasons, including theft of sensitive information, financial gain,
                    or to disrupt or damage computer systems. It is an illegal and unethical practice that can have serious
                    consequences if caught. To protect against hacking, it is important to use strong passwords, keep software
                    up to date, and be cautious when opening emails or clicking on links from unknown sources.

                    Coding refers to the process of writing instructions or computer programs using a specific programming
                    language. It involves the use of logical reasoning, problem-solving and attention to detail to convert
                    ideas into computer-understandable instructions. Coding can be done manually, but it is more common
                    to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write code. Programming languages used for coding
                    can vary depending on the intended use, but popular languages include Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
                    Coding has numerous applications, including website development, game design, software development, and data analysis.
